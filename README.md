# RoutineRemind

RoutineRemind is a mobile (iOS/Android) and web application that was selected by U.S. Representative Jennifer Wexton as the winner of the Congressional App Challenge from Virginia's 10th District. Since then, it has been provisionally patented and is currently utility patent-pending. The application is designed to aid individuals with cognitive and speech impairments, with a focus on children with autism and their families. Using the app, parents can create daily schedules for their children by recording multiple action items for the day. When a user asks a question about their routine, the app plays back the matching recording from the parent, which reduces maladaptive behavior in children with autism. The app incorporates machine learning algorithms and natural language processing libraries to match the child's question with the corresponding recording from the parent. The app's frontend was built using Javascript, Typescript, and HTML/CSS. Authentication and scheduling data in the backend was stored in the backend through Google Firebase.
