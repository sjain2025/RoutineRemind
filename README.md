# RoutineRemind

RoutineRemind is a patent-pending mobile and web application that was selected by U.S. Representative Jennifer Wexton as the winner of the Congressional App Challenge from Virginia's 10th District. The application is designed to aid individuals with cognitive and speech impairments, with a focus on children with autism and their families. Using the app, parents can create daily schedules for their children by recording multiple action items for the day. When a user asks a question about their routine, the app plays back the matching recording from the parent, which reduces maladaptive behavior in children with autism. The app incorporates machine learning algorithms and natural language processing libraries to match the child's question with the corresponding recording from the parent.

RoutineRemind was built using:
- React
- Javascript
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Google Firebase (login authentication and scheduling data)
